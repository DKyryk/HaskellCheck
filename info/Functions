1) Higher order functions

Haskell functions can take functions as parameters and return functions as return values.
A function that does either of those is called a higher order function.
Every function in Haskell officially only takes one parameter.
All the functions that accepted several parameters so far have been curried functions.
If you call function with several parameters internally it transform to sub function with one parameter that returns another function.
By calling functions with too few parameters, so to speak, we're creating new functions on the fly.

2) Sections

Infix functions can also be partially applied by using sections.
To section an infix function, simply surround it with parentheses and only supply a parameter on one side.
That creates a function that takes one parameter and then applies it to the side that's missing an operand.
