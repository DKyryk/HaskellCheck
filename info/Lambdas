Lambdas are basically anonymous functions that are used because we need some functions only once.
Normally, we make a lambda with the sole purpose of passing it to a higher-order function.
To make a lambda, we write a \ (because it kind of looks like the greek letter lambda if you squint hard enough)
and then we write the parameters, separated by spaces.
After that comes a -> and then the function body.
We usually surround them by parentheses, because otherwise they extend all the way to the right.
